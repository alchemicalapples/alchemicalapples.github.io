The theme was "Evolution".

It's a standard tower defense, except you're dealt random cards that you use to place and upgrade towers.
Upgrades can be combined in various ways to create unique towers.

This is the first game project I really took seriously. This is also the first regular Ludum Dare I participated in.

I used Java and AWT to create an embedded applet, because I liked the idea of everyone being able to play the game right in their browser.
This turned out pretty well, the game got a decent number of positive comments, with only a couple of reports of the game not loading.

I also chose Java because I really looked up to Notch, and he made all of his games in Java at the time. This was despite the fact that I already knew I didn't like Java.

Here in the future, well, it turns out that Java 6 applets simply don't work anymore.
So much for that esteemed portability, huh?

I've lost the original source code, so everything in the repo is decompiled from the JAR.
Although, looking at it, it's pretty dang accurate.
The class files weren't obfuscated or optimized in any way.
