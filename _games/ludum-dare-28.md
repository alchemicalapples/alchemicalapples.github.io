The theme was "You Only Get One".

In this case, you only get one minute to dig up as many coins as you can! Get 50 gold to beat each level.

This team was one of the largest I've worked with. Two programmers, two artists, a designer, and a musician.

Created using a custom engine written in C++. This is the last game I made using my "Inugami" rendering library.

Team is credited on the submission page.
