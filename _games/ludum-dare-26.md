The theme was "Minimalism".

I wanted to see if I could make an interesting platformer with as few tile and enemy types as possible.

The graphics are also 8x8 sprites to add to the minimalism.

Created using a custom engine written in C++. This is the first game I made using my Inugami rendering library.

I created everything except the sprites.
