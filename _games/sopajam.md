This was kind of a weird jam.
It was hosted on the Ludum Dare site, but wasn't really part of the main event schedule.

The purpose was to protest the impending SOPA and PIPA laws (and eventually ACTA).

This game is literally just Pong, but with an image shown over the middle of the game area.
The idea was that the game had been censored, and you could only see the far sides of the screen.

It was written in C++ with raw OpenGL calls (fixed pipeline).
