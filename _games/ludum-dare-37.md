The theme was "One Room".

The game is a first-person shooter where you have to survive in a room while enemies keep spawning. Heavily inspired by Devil Daggers.

Created using the [Urho3D][urho3d] engine.

Urho3D was nice to work with, but for some reason my game fails to load on certain systems. I couldn't figure out why this was happening, so my Ludum Dare submission received zero ratings. It worked on about half of my friends' machines.

Solo jam entry.
