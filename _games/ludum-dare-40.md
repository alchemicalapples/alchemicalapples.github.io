The theme is "The more you have, the worse it is".

Our game interprets the theme literally, where your controls become less responsive based on the alcohol you've collected. However, you need to collect all the beers to complete each stage.

Created using a custom engine written in C++.

My role was engine and game logic code.

This game was made with two of my coworkers, Jacob and Sean, and my friend Chume.

Jacob made all the art and audio, Sean did a lot of the coding, and Chume made all the levels on the last day.

Most of the game was developed from Sean's apartment.
