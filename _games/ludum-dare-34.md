The theme was tied between "Two Button Controls" and "Growing".

My game uses only the left and right arrow keys, and is a sort of roguelite RPG mixed with a bullet hell.

This game was super fun to make.
I spent a lot of time writing a custom shader to get the fisheye effect to work just right.

I had bigger plans for this game, and maybe I'll revisit it one day.

A lot of people compared this game to Undertale.
I hadn't played Undertale at the time, but I can't be sure that I wasn't influenced by it.

Created using a custom engine written in C++.
This was the first of my games to use my Sushi rendering library.

Solo jam entry.
