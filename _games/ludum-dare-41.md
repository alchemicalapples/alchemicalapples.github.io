The theme is "Combine 2 Incompatible Genres".

We came up with this "golf + tower defense" idea.

Created using a custom engine written in C++ and Lua.

We made this game all in my apartment over the weekend.
I bought some Ikea desks for them to use, and turned my dining room into a gamedev room.

My role was engine code and scripting, and I made the menu screen artwork.
