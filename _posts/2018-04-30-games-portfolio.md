I've started taking this site a bit more seriously.

There is now a Games page where you can view a list of all the games I've created.
No binary files are available yet, but I plan on uploading all the sources to GitHub and eventually tagging releases with binary downloads.

I've also changed my GitHub username to `apples`!
This name fits more with the name I use on a lot of other sites, which is "Alchemical Apples".
