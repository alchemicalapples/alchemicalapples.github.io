This is my first blog post.

I plan on making this site more than just a blog, but I'm using this as an opportunity to learn Jekyll.

Jekyll has been amazing to use so far. I don't really like how the default filenames and URL paths are set up, but that's all easily changed.

This site is, of course, located on GitHub at [dbralir/dbralir.github.io][git-repo].
